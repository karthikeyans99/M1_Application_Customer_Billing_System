Although graphics has not been used in this project, the application of user defined functions and structures have been effectively used here. The major user defined functions used in this C project are:

1. void input()
2. void writefile()
3. void search()
4. void output()
The function void input() is used to add the new customer account i.e. with the help of this functions the parameters such as name, address, phone number, amount paid etc. are asked and entered. Another function void writefile() has been utilized to create a file on hard disk of computer for storing the information and data of a customer.

The function void search() has been used to look for previously stored accounts either by name or by number of the customer. The fourth and the last user defined function used in this Customer Billing System Project in C is void output() which has been defined to show the result as console output.

In Customer Billing System, structure has very beautifully used to group the data type in single unit. The date variables (day, month and year) have been grouped in the structures named date where as other variables such as name, number, street, paid amount etc. are grouped under another structure named account.
